title: "Week 3: Mathematical Foundations of DL and Data Pipelines with TF"
date: 2019-09-09
---
The Week# 3 of our course broadly covers:
* Review of Deep Learning (DL) concepts
* Mathematical foundations of DL
* Building data pipelines for TensorFlow 2.0

We review basic concepts of Deep Learning in [Lecture# 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf9koajUwmo&list=PLOzRYVm0a65cTV_t0BYj-nV8VX_Me6Es3&index=9).
We begin with Neural Network representation of Linear and Logistic regression and from there go on to explain basic 
concepts of Deep Learning.

After explaining the basic concepts, we present a colab on mathematical foundations of Deep Learning.  Tensor is a 
basic data structure for storing data in memory during Deep Learning operations.  We cover basics of Tensor and fundamental mathematical operations on tensor that are commonly used in Deep Learning:

* [Lecture 11](https://youtu.be/2-aP2pPtzRE)

Later in the week, we will explore how to build data pipelines in TensorFlow 2.0 for variety of input formats like CSV, images and text:
* [Lecture 12A](https://youtu.be/cwKc7mOQHLI), [Lecture# 12B](https://youtu.be/M8wsn0VQjXE), [Lecture# 12C](https://youtu.be/bzbsUam_tyU)
* [Lecture 13](https://youtu.be/MNwFBWeXOAQ)

Hope you enjoy learning TensorFlow 2.0 with us! Do let us know your feedback and ask questions on the course forum.
