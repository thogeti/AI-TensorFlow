The first lecture provides an overview of [TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org)(TF), which is 
a machine learning platform of choice for many ML developers around the world.  Tensorflow is 
developed by Google Brain team and was open sourced in Nov 2015.  Since then it has been one 
of the most popular GitHub repo with more than 133K stars and an active community of over 
2100 developers (Stats as of Aug 29, 2019).   

Take a few minutes to look at this [inspiring application](https://youtu.be/NlpS-DhayQA) of 
tensorflow in agriculture for detecting plant diseases.   A lot of companies around the world 
are using Tensorflow to build diverse business applications around AI and ML.  Check out 
some of the [case studies](https://www.tensorflow.org/about/case-studies/) about business 
problems solved by these corporations.

Tensorflow 2.0 is the latest release candidate (RC).   TF 2.0 provies easy to use APIs 
for building ML models.  One can train an ML model for handwritten digit recognition in 
less than 10 lines of code, check out 
[this colab](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/quickstart/beginner) for such 
a model.

We will be using [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com) for developing ML models.
Please take a moment to get yourself familiarize with Colab tool.  Colab can be thought 
of as a Jupyter notebook in cloud that needs zero configuration.  It provides hardware 
accelerators like GPUs and TPUs and allow sharing of work with collaborators through 
Google drive.
